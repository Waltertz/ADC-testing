                  ADC Tanzania Limited is registered and licensed to operate in
                  Tanzania. It is a sister company to ADC Rwanda which has been
                  operating in Rwanda since 2006. ADC was formed after observing
                  the gaps in most businesses in Rwanda and Tanzania that affect
                  business growth and sustainable performance. Such gaps called
                  for the need to consider provision of Business Development
                  Service aiming to transform businesses in the two countries to
                  achieve sustainable growth and performance.
